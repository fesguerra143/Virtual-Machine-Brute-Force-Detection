## 1. Summary
Date of Notes: June 21, 2025 <br />
Incident Type: Brute-Force Logon Attempts <br />
Status: Contained <br />


## 2. Initial Detection & Analysis
### Methodology:
An analytics rule (potentially in Microsoft Sentinel) was configured to detect a high volume of failed logon attempts. The following Kusto Query Language (KQL) query was utilized to identify devices experiencing a significant number of LogonFailed events within a 5-hour window:

##### Rule logic Testing using Log Analytics Workspace

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(5h)
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| summarize NumberOfFailures = count() by RemoteIP, ActionType, DeviceName
| where NumberOfFailures >= 10

```

### üìä Analysis
A brute force detection rule in Microsoft Sentinel flagged multiple failed login attempts originating from two distinct public IP addresses. These were targeting two separate virtual machines in our environment:

| Remote IP      | Target VM      | Failed Logons |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| 27.124.47.210  | panbear-2nd-vm | 26            |
| 103.159.255.76 | hercules-soc   | 40            |


## 3. Investigation
#### ‚úÖ Verification of Access Attempts
A follow-up query was used to verify whether any of the suspicious IP addresses had successful logins:

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where RemoteIP in ("27.124.47.210", "103.159.255.76")
| where ActionType != "LogonFailed"
```
![analyticrulecreation7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4136541e-8f34-4b73-96c5-6739739fbed9)

#### Result:
üîí No successful logins were observed from the flagged IP addresses.

## 4. Containment Actions Taken
### Isolated Devices:
Both panbear-2nd-vm and hercules-soc were isolated in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) to prevent further compromise.

###  Malware Scan:
A full anti-malware scan was initiated and completed on both VMs using MDE.

###  NSG Lockdown:
Network Security Group (NSG) rules were updated:
RDP access from the public internet was blocked.
Only the investigator‚Äôs home IP is currently allowed RDP access.
A Bastion host was proposed as a more secure alternative for future access.

### Policy Recommendation:
A recommendation has been submitted to enforce restricted RDP access for all virtual machines across the environment.
