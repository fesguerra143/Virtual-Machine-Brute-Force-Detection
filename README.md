## 1. Summary
Date of Notes: June 21, 2025 < br />
Incident Type: Brute-Force Logon Attempts < br />
Status: Contained < br />


## 2. Initial Detection & Analysis
### Methodology:
An analytics rule (potentially in Microsoft Sentinel) was configured to detect a high volume of failed logon attempts. The following Kusto Query Language (KQL) query was utilized to identify devices experiencing a significant number of LogonFailed events within a 5-hour window:

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(5h)
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| summarize NumberOfFailures = count() by RemoteIP, ActionType, DeviceName
| where NumberOfFailures >= 10

```
